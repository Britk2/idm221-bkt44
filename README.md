## __*Content Inventory*__

    I was born and raised in the Greater Philadelphia Area. Once I turned 5, my family moved to Phoenixville where I continued to go to school for the next 12 years(Phoenixville Area School District). Once I graduated highschool, I started to study at Drexel University for a Bachalor's Degree in Interactive Digital Media and minor in Graphic Design.

    From a young age I would always visit Florida every year to see my relatives down there. Outside of that, I have traveled to various other states such as Colorado, California, Texas, Illinois, and all the states down the east coast due to road trips to Florida and vacationing to Maine once. Outside the USA, I have visited Canada on several occasion and been to Australlia.

    From a very young age I was always interested in the arts, more towards the traditional side of things. However, as I grew older, I thought for the sustainability of my career and has also peaked my interest, included more tech and coding into what I wanted to work with when I grew older. So because of this, I took AP Computer Science, AP Statistics, AP Physics I, and AP Psychology thinking it would help me with a career in Graphic Design. It is until I got accepted to Drexel, where I learned of the major for IDM and how it included all my interests and more focusing on the experience of what I make. 

    For the future, I hope to do something with designing experiences, websites, things of that nature. I still wish to do more the visual side of the design since I can see how I can progress during the project. Studying code and development will also be crutial for me to suceed in the future as a designer moving forward.
